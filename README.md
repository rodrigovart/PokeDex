# PokeDex

This is a simple iOS app that demonstrates the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architectural pattern using Swift. The app fetches data from the Pokémon API (pokeapi.co) and displays a list of Pokémon with their images and names.

## Features

- Fetches a list of Pokémon from the Pokémon API
- Fetches Pokémon details for each Pokémon in the list
- Displays Pokémon images, names, and types in a collection view
- Uses Alamofire and AlamofireImage for network requests and image loading
- Utilizes RxSwift for reactive programming
- Implements MVVM architecture for separation of concerns and testability
